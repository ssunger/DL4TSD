# DL for your ARIMA model

The repository's goal is to create a model that utilizes LSTM model to choose the most appropriate simple model for TS prediction. This repository will consist of:

  1. [ ] A package created for implementing TS models within a Deep Learning network based on PyTorch
  2. [ ] Relevant papers to this implementation
  3. [ ] A package for data attainment and dataset creation for the Learning Algo
  4. [ ] The model implemented
