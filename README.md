The package goal is to create a mdoel that utilizes LSTM model to choose the most appropriate simple model for TS prediction. This repositroy will consist of:

  1. [ ] A package created for implementing TS models within a Deep Learning network based on PyTorch
  2. [ ] Relavent papers to this implementations
  3. [ ] A package for data attainment and dataset creation for the Learning Algo
  4. [ ] The model implemented
